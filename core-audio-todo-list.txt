- proposed design decisions:

* i vote we don't do x86 support. That begs the question, should it be dropped for the other backends as well. Thoughts?

- a random list of might-be-interesting:

* Should we ask the initial issue submitter for MacOS support (notshriram) to help out testing?
* PortAudio's core-audio backend: https://github.com/EddieRingle/portaudio/blob/master/src/hostapi/coreaudio/pa_mac_core.c#L1147
* CAStreamBasicDescription (ancient): https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4033905/what-is-the-difference-between-castreambasicdescription-and-audiostreambasicdesc
* do we need to worry about endianness? for x64? for arm?

- figure out stuff that will impact the implementation:

* can we do direct-to-hw-access?
* can we do software-mixed access?
* can we do loopback-recording?
* can we do (non)interleaved or both?
* can we do channelmapping?
* can we do accurate time-and-position reporting?
* which of XtDeviceCaps and XtServiceCaps are supported by CoreAudio? and which of those do we want to support?

- actually implement it, wrote some guidelines below, ideally these are possible but not a hard requirement:

* Service API (entry point) => should be light weight, not "open" any devices, just query metadata
* DeviceList API (device metadata) => also lightweight, not "open" any devices, this is meant to quickly produce a list of (stable across sessions!) device identifiers + names
* Device API (format and buffer size support) => allowed to do more heavy lifting (e.g. query HW driver for format support)
* Stream API => this is where it happens! But usually, Device::OpenStream is the most complicated to implement in any backend.

- all the other boring stuff:

-- basic-setup:
V update the version number
V re-check all #if _WIN32 and explicitly make sure it fails to compile if we are not 1) win or 2) lin or 3) mac => no implicit assumptions
V re-check all WIN32 in the cmake files and make it explicit, too
V figure out the calling convention, if any
V figure out the export/visibility magic (dllexport/attribute-visibility-default)
V introduce XT_ENABLE_CORE_AUDIO build switch and wire it up everywhere
V hunt down all occurrences of XT_ENABLE_XYZ
* make sure we can run "list all devices" driver on win/lin
* dont forget to mention realtime-waits-for-nothing
* make a PR for set-up-the-basics
* make skeleton implementation
* make it build on mac
* add xcode build script just to generate the project files
* add clang build script to do the actual build
* build the skeleton on Win, Lin, and Mac
* build with visibility=hidden and visibility-inlines=hidden

-- testing and java/net:
* add test script to run the native console-based driver
* fix up the java-to-native bindings library loading
* fix up the netcore-to-native bindings library loading
* bundle up the the dylib with the nuget package
* bundle up the dylib in the jar file
* check the TODOs in code and build scripts
* Re-test everything => windows, Linux, and macos.

-- when all is done:
* update the documentation => really check library.dox and the readme and the website
* update the GitHub readme
* update the GH.io website
* write up a credits document
